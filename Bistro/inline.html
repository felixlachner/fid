    <h2><i>Low and Slow</i></h2>
    <p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <b><em><dfn>sous vide.</dfn></b></em> In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, Cooking for Geeks,<cite> Jeff Potter</cite> describes it as: <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
    <p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. </p>
